# dbUnit Mirror

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dbunit/dbunit-mirror.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/dbunit/dbunit-mirror/branches)

This repository is a mirror of the official dbUnit http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/ repository located at https://sourceforge.net/p/dbunit/code.git/ci/master/tree/ for builds.  Please refer to that site for more information.

To contribute, please refer to the Developers Guide http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/devguide.html.

Note: master is not the default GitHub branch so the SF -> GH sync action can overwrite GH master.
